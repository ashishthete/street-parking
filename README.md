# street-parking

we are building a street parking spot reservation service. Each parking spot is identified by
its location (lat, lng). Users should be able to view street parking spots, reserve and pay for the parking
spots or cancel their reservations.

Requirements
• See available parking spots on a map
• Search for an address and find nearby parking spot. (input: lat, lng, radius in meters. Output - list of
parking spots within the radius).
• Reserve a parking spot
• View existing reservations
• Cancel an existing reservation
• Show the user the cost of the reservation
